# Resume Database Website

## About
This website showcases the resume and profiles of members in the Society of Scientists and Engineers (SASE) â€“  University of Minnesota Twin Cities chapter. 

As the Corporate Director of SASE, I was inspired to create this website to better connect students with corporations and strengthen our industry networks. It serves as a platform for compiling and sharing student resumes. The official version of this website is sent as an exclusive resource to our corporate sponsors. 

## View the website
